<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>(Last Revised: August 4, 2014)</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting this web site. We understand the importance that Internet users place on privacy, and this Privacy Policy describes how we use personal information that is collected at this web site.</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy before using this site or submitting any personal information.</p>
<p>By using this web site, you accept the privacy practices contained in this Privacy Policy. These privacy practices may change from time to time, but any changes will be posted. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy whenever you visit the web site to make sure you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>A. Personally Identifiable Information (Including Data That Is Shared With Third Parties)</p>
<p>In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable information, like names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sometimes credit card information when such information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information, transfer your personal information, and/or sell your personal information for any legal purpose, including, without limitation: (1) to deliver the products and/or services to you that you have requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the terms and conditions; (3) for content improvement and feedback purposes; (4) to reach you, when necessary, regarding your use of the web site or product(s); and (5) to bring retail opportunities and promotional offers to you by email, direct mail, telemarketing, and/or online banner advertising.</p>
<p>By submitting your contact and personal information on this web site, you agree to allow us to perform an analysis and then forward your information (including your email and phone number) to the third party service provider that best matches your profile, based upon your location and demographics. If we work with a Professional Matchmaker in your local geographic area, we will share your data with them so they can contact you by phone and/or email to schedule an interview.</p>
<p>If an online dating company is a better match for your profile, we will share your data with that company so they can offer you the opportunity to establish a membership account, often at preferred rates.</p>
<p>On the page that appears after you submit your age and location to us, we will specify what company we determined was the best match to your information. You will then be provided with an opportunity to confirm that your data  can be shared with the specific company we matched you with.</p>
<p>It is our goal to get you to the right place to help you achieve your matchmaking goals. Be assured that we respect your privacy and are not going to share your data with dozens of companies that will bombard you with unwanted messages. We will only share your data with the specific company that we matched you with after getting your consent.</p>
<p>We, and our third party service providers, may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do.</p>
<p>By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for custom audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us.</p>
<p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your telephone contact information on this web site and/or registering to receive the product and/or service offered herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16 CFR '310 et seq. and any applicable state and local &quot;do not call&quot; regulations. We and the specific third party service providers receiving your data as described herein retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR and the applicable state regulations.</p>
<p>When your information is provided to third parties, these third parties may also include providers of direct marketing services and applications. We or these third parties may supplement the information we collect online with outside records to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and/or to offer you targeted advertising and other opportunities to purchase products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>We will NEVER share your credit card information with third parties unless you have given us explicit permission to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted from us.</p>
<p>By permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to receive information on other products and services that may be of interest to you, including related third party offers that we may send to you. You also enable us to personalize your experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of service.</p>
<p>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>We also may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information to help us make your experience more enjoyable, measure site activity to identify future improvements that should be made, and compile aggregate data to help serve site visitors better.</p>
<p>For example, we may use session and persistent &quot;cookies,&quot; session logs, web beacons, GIF/pixel tags, banner ads, third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Google Analytics), third party retargeting networks that may display our advertisements to you on other sites that you visit to remind you about us, and third party networks that serve user-requested emails (e.g., for a refer-a-friend email) to collect non-personally identifiable or other aggregated information about site visitors.</p>
<p>Cookies are text files that are used by your computer's web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your user experience with our web site.</p>
<p>Emails or newsletters that we send electronically may use techniques such as web beacons or pixel tags to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader's experience, such as the number of emails that are opened, whether they were forwarded or printed, the type of device from which they were opened, and the location (e.g. city, state, and county) associated with the applicable IP address.</p>
<p>If you visit this site with an open ID (such as Facebook), you may also be sharing and integrating data with third-party social media sites, and we may track aggregate data about the number of visits to this site with an open ID, the number of items &quot;liked&quot; on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.</p>
<p>Other parties such as third party service providers, advertising partners, and analytics companies may also be collecting information about your online activity across various websites over time. The information collected by those third parties may include identifiers that allow those third parties to tailor the ads that they serve to your computer or other device.</p>
<p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals other than cookies, we do not currently respond to &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals that are undefined.<br/>
Please note that you do have the option to configure most web browsers to NOT accept cookies. However, be aware that disabling cookies may keep you from having access to some functions or services on our web site or the web-hosted software that runs on our web site.</p>

<h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly intend to collect personally identifiable information from children under 18 years of age. If your minor child has provided us with personally identifiable information, you may contact us at the phone number or mailing address listed in Section 6 herein if you want this information deleted from our records. We will then make reasonable efforts to remove your child's information from the database that stores the information.</p>

<h2>4. IP Addresses</h2>
<p>We may use your IP address to help prevent fraud, to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather broad demographic information, and to offer you products and services.</p>

<h2>5. Commitment to Data Security</h2>
<p>All information collected from you is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. Furthermore, employees, contractors, and vendors who have access to your personally identifiable information in connection with providing services for us are required to keep the information confidential.<br/>
  Unfortunately, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take reasonable measures to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
